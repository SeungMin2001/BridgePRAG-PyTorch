BridgePRAG is a compact research codebase for encoding retrieved evidence into
learned **K/V memory slots** and injecting them into a frozen decoder-only LLM.
It starts from the MergePRAG/HyperKV direction, then changes the memory encoder
with a Fusion-in-Decoder-style question-passage boundary and a lightweight
linear **KV adapter** for calibration.

A paper based on this project has been accepted by the **Korean Digital Contents
Society** (**한국디지털콘텐츠학회**). Publication details will be added after the
proceedings are released.

## At a Glance

BridgePRAG asks a simple question: can retrieved passages be compressed into
small trainable K/V memories that are already aware of the user question?

Instead of generating memory from a passage alone, BridgePRAG encodes
`question + passage`, creates HyperKV slots, calibrates them with a lightweight
adapter, and injects the resulting memory into a frozen decoder-only model.
The goal is to provide a compact reference implementation for researchers and
engineers exploring decoder-only RAG memory.

**Current validation snapshot**

- +43.00 hit accuracy over passage-only memory on the entity-style validation setup.
- +24.67 F1 score over passage-only memory.
- Faster average inference time in the reported comparison.
- Test-set and train/validation visualizations show faster convergence and higher accuracy than the passage-only baseline.

## Why BridgePRAG?

- **Question-conditioned memory**: encode `question + passage` before generating HyperKV slots.
- **FiD-inspired boundary**: move from passage-only memory toward query-aware evidence encoding.
- **KV adapter correction**: learn linear residual corrections for generated key/value slots.
- **Decoder-only compatible**: inject memory through a selected transformer layer without fine-tuning the base LLM.
- **Reproducible research layout**: installable package, toy data, training CLI, inference CLI, tests, figures, citation file.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeungMin2001/BridgePRAG.git
cd BridgePRAG
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For GPU runs, install the PyTorch build that matches your CUDA version first:

```bash
python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart

Train a tiny BridgePRAG memory generator:

```bash
bridgeprag train \
  --data examples/data/tiny_memory.jsonl \
  --output runs/tiny_bridgeprag.pt \
  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B \
  --num-kv 8 \
  --hidden-dim 512 \
  --critical-layer 8 \
  --epochs 1 \
  --max-steps 3
```

Run question-conditioned memory inference:

```bash
bridgeprag infer \
  --checkpoint runs/tiny_bridgeprag.pt \
  --question "What does the KV adapter correct?" \
  --passage "The KV adapter applies lightweight linear corrections to generated key and value slots."
```

Python API:

```python
from bridgeprag import BridgePRAG

bridge = BridgePRAG.from_checkpoint("runs/tiny_bridgeprag.pt")
answer = bridge.generate(
    question="What does the KV adapter correct?",
    passages=[
        "The KV adapter applies lightweight linear corrections to generated key and value slots."
    ],
)
print(answer)
```

## Method

BridgePRAG trains only a small HyperKV generator while the base LLM stays frozen.

1. Encode retrieved evidence as either `passage` or `question + passage`.
2. Project token features into slot-wise hidden states with attentive pooling.
3. Produce `K` and `V` memory slots.
4. Apply a linear KV adapter: `K = K + A_k(K)`, `V = V + A_v(V)`.
5. Inject memory into a selected decoder layer with cross-attention.
6. Merge multiple passages through orthogonal slot composition.

The main contrast is:

| Variant | Memory encoder input | Slot correction | Intended effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Passage-only HyperKV | passage | none | compact external memory |
| BridgePRAG | question + passage | linear KV adapter | query-aware, calibrated memory |

See [docs/method.md](docs/method.md) for the full research note.

## Results Snapshot

The current BridgePRAG branch reports the following question+passage memory vs
passage-only memory comparison on an entity-style validation setup.

| Metric | Question+Passage | Passage-only | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Accuracy (Hit) | 84.00 | 41.00 | +43.00 |
| Precision | 69.78 | 45.58 | +24.21 |
| Recall | 86.73 | 63.28 | +23.45 |
| F1 Score | 76.19 | 51.52 | +24.67 |
| QA Score | 38.26 | 26.16 | +12.10 |
| Avg. Time (s) | 4.17 | 4.83 | -0.66 |

**Takeaway.** Question-conditioned memory improves both retrieval-grounded
answer quality and efficiency: higher hit accuracy, higher F1, higher QA score,
and lower average latency in this validation snapshot.

### Test-set Learning Curve

The original test-set visualization is kept as the primary comparison figure.
It shows the question-conditioned BridgePRAG model rising sharply in accuracy
while the passage-only baseline improves more slowly. The loss curve follows the
same pattern: BridgePRAG reaches lower loss earlier, suggesting that the model
uses question-aware memory slots more effectively than passage-only memory.

### Training Curve Comparison

The two training visualizations below compare BridgePRAG against the
passage-only baseline under the same epoch budget. BridgePRAG reduces
validation loss more aggressively and reaches near-saturated validation accuracy,
while the passage-only baseline improves more slowly and remains accuracy-limited.

## Dataset Format

Minimal JSONL:

```json
{"source_id":"ex1","passage":"...","question":"...","answer":"...","full_answer":"..."}
```

Augmented rows may include `qas`, `atomic_qas`, `final_qas`, and
`hard_negatives`; the loader expands them into independent memory supervision
examples.
